electrical engineering
the branch of engineering science that studies the uses of electricity and the equipment for power generation and distribution and the control of machines and communication
circuit
an electrical device that provides a path for electrical current to flow
resistance
a material's opposition to the flow of electric current
electrical device
a device that produces or is powered by electricity
AC circuit
an electrical network in which the voltage polarity and directions of current flow change continuously, and often periodically
conduction current
the drift of electrons in a conductor (or of electrons and holes in a semiconductor)
closed circuit
a complete electrical circuit around which current flows or a signal circulates
open circuit
an incomplete electrical circuit in which no current flows
loop
a length of line folded over and joined at the ends so as to form a curve or circle
impedance
a material's opposition to the flow of electric current
conduction
the passage of electricity through a conductor
discharge
